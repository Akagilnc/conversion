# conversion
Conversion between different types of denotes.

I built a site api.whatiknowaboutyou.info to provide such services.

Currently, it contains converting chinese numbers to arabic numbers, for example:
acess the url

`api.whatiknowaboutyou.info/chinese2arabic/两千零一十七`

will get the result 2017.

You can add query like `strict=true` to check input and `format=json` to get json result.
